                            <p>Hey how are you! My name is Warren Spencer and I am a Software Engineer from Birmingham, AL. All of my life I have always been fascinated by computers and technology. 
                            I wanted to go to college and study Computer Science in order to pursue a career in software development. In 2020, I graduated from Lawson State Community 
                            College with an Associates in the Applied Science degree in Computer Science. In 2023, I graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a 
                            Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science. Software development is my passion! I am dedicated to developing software and applications by using programming
                            languages, frameworks, and database management tools. My love for software developement is not only at a professional level but also at a personal level as well.
                            I spend my free time developing side programming projects with various technologies and tools in order to learn more about the field of software engineering
                            and to grow as a developer. I am also into freelancing and providing services to clients who need help with their software projects.
                            I have interests in AI and Cybersecurity as well. My hobbies outside of software development are video games and drawing. If you are interested in collaborating with me feel free to reach out!
